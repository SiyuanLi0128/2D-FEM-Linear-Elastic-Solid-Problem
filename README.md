This educational solver demonstrates core Finite Element Method (FEM) principles for 2D linear elastic problems, providing a foundation for both academic instruction and future extension to nonlinear mechanics simulations.

Key Features:

Complete implementation of linear elastic FEM formulation

Clear separation of core FEM components (stiffness assembly, BC application)

Modular design for easy extension to nonlinear problems

Integrated visualization of displacements and stress fields

Implementation Details:
Built with scientific Python ecosystem including:

MeshPy (2022.1.3)

Shapely (2.0.7)
